💻🥷🏽 About ME:

My name is Norberto and I am a BI developer / data engineer with an interest in cybersecurity currently pursuing my MSBA at Cal Poly Pomona. I am currently looking into the use of statistics for risk management. I believe that under the right circumstances data can be used to support security, resilience and reliability efforts by providing accurate insights in a timely fashion from potential risk factors. My hope is that this will help improve the likelyhood of ensuring our leaders are able to make thier decisions based on accurate, verifiable data that can best approximate an instantaneous and dynamic view of the ground truth.

💼🦾 Mission Statement:

We live in a time of great change and transformation and with that comes hightened risks from various threat vectors including the (mis)use of technology by bad faith actors and authoritarian regimes. Considering the dangers that are inherent in the use of oppressive surveillance technology that can be wielded, for instance, to target dissident journalists and activists (as some already have), it is imperative that we take it upon ourselves to excercise the utmost level of discretion with regard to data collection and data preservation. It matters a great deal to me that people are able to live in a free and open society so i try to take the issue of data privacy very seriously and am always open to suggestions that will lead to learning and improving.

🤷🏽‍♂️🔮 What to Expect:

Notwithstanding these risks however there are various ways to preserve data integrity and data privacy that i look forward to discussing in the future, both on the policy side w/ regard to security and data privacy frameworks, as well as the technical side with regard to secure database management, port management, encryption, authentication and the use of Data Analysis tools to create innovative data-driven solutions to identify bottlenecks and/or threat vectors along the supply chain and/or other point of concern in a manner more akin to Incident Response. Expect to see some work with Python and Ghidra down the road as well as the use of Markov Chains for Fraud detection.

👯🤝 Collaboration:

Currently solidifying my skillset but in the mid to long term i am looking to collaborate with likeminded professionals in either the data or cybersecurity space to potentially collaborate with on some robust and complex solutions to some of the current preassing issues we collectively face as a people and possibly a future business venture around the idea of penetration testing and incident response as a service on a local level. Willing to work with people from anywhere around the globe that have similar interests and priorities. Other ideas are also being considered particularly with regard to aquatics and IoT. Also looking to see if i can be of help to anybody that is already working on data-driven cybersecurity solutions. Open to discussing further in private. 🧐 DMs welcome.
